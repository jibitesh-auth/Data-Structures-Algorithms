/*
Problem: Print the Day of the Week

Problem Statement:
Given an integer day representing the day number of the week, print the corresponding day name.

Mapping:
1 -> Monday
2 -> Tuesday
3 -> Wednesday
4 -> Thursday
5 -> Friday
6 -> Saturday
7 -> Sunday

If the value of day is less than 1 or greater than 7, print "Invalid".

Note:
- Print the day name with only the first letter capitalized.
- Print "Invalid" exactly as specified.

Input:
- A single integer day.

Output:
- Print the corresponding day of the week or "Invalid".

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3

Output:
Wednesday

Explanation:
Day number 3 corresponds to Wednesday.

Example 2:
Input:
8

Output:
Invalid

Explanation:
Since 8 is not a valid day number (1–7), print "Invalid".

Example 3:
Input:
2

Output:
Tuesday

Explanation:
Day number 2 corresponds to Tuesday.

Constraints:
0 <= day <= 50
